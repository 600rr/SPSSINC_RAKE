<p>SPSSINC RAKE /HELP.  prints this information and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>SPSSINC RAKE 
DIM1=jobcat 1 500 2 300 3 200
DIM2=minority 1 800 2 200 
FINALWEIGHT=weight.
/PLOT YVAR=jobcat XVAR=minority.
</code></pre>
<pre class="example"><code>SPSSINC RAKE 
FINALWEIGHT=WEIGHT
/DS1 DS=jobcatmarginals CATVAR=jobcat TOTVAR=totals
/DS2 DS=minoritymarginals CATVAR=minority TOTVAR=totals
</code></pre>

<p>This procedure uses the GENLOG procedure and, therefore, 
requires the SPSS Statistics Advanced Statistics option.</p>

<p>There is an article on raking using this procedure available
from the SPSS Community website at this location:<br/>
<a href="http://ibm.co/1mlaUIr">http://ibm.co/1mlaUIr</a>
The article is also installed with this extension in the subdirectory
where the extension spe file is stored.</p>

<p>If a weight is active when this command is run, it is
incorporated into the calculation.  After the command completes,
the FINALWEIGHT variable will be set to be the weighting variable.</p>

<p>Up to 10 control total dimensions can be specified. 
in either of two ways.
Only numeric variables can be used for control totals.<br/>
<ul>
<li>Using DIM1, &hellip;, DIM10.
Each specification consists of a variable name followed by
a list of category values and the total or fraction for that category.
For example,<br/>
1 500 2 300 3 200</br>
would specify categories 1, 2, and 3 with category one
having 500 cases and so on.
</li>
<li>Using /DS1 , &hellip;, /DS10.  Each subcommand contains
a dataset specification, the name of the categorical variable, and
the name of the totals variable.  Each case in the dataset
specifies the category value and the corresponding control total or fraction.
</li>

  

<p><strong>DS</strong> specifies the name of a dataset containing
the marginal totals for a variable.</p>
<p><strong>CATVAR</strong> specifies the name of the categorical
variable whose marginal totals are containing in this dataset.  This
variable must exist in both this control dataset and the main dataset.</p>
<p><strong>TOTVAR</strong> specifies the name of the variable containing
the marginal totals or fractions.</li>
</ul>
  <p>The control total can also be a numerical expression.  If
  an expression is used, enclose the expression in quotes.  For
  example, 
  <p><pre>
  1 "1594 / (1594 + 603)" 2 ".87 *.28"  </pre>
  <p>If the values are specified using a dataset, the control total variable
  can be a string containing the expression.</p>
</p>
<p>Both DIM and DS specifications can be used in the same command.
For example, DS1
might be used to specify the totals for a variable with many categories
while DIM2 might specify totals for a variable with only a few categories.
Up to ten dimensions can be specified.</p>
<p>If a category is encountered in the data for which there is no
control total, the weight for that category will be system missing.</p>
<p>Note: with many dimensions and categories this command might run out of memory on 32-bit systems 
or take a long time to complete.</p>

<p><strong>FINALWEIGHT</strong> names a new variable to contain the weight.</p>

<p><strong>POPTOTAL</strong> can be specified as a number that the weights should sum to.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p>The <strong>DELTA</strong>, <strong>ITERATIONS</strong>, and <strong>CONVERGENCE</strong> settings correspond to
the same GENLOG parameters.  The defaults are DELTA=.5, ITERATIONS=20,
CONVERGENCE= .0001.  If the generated weights do not produce the
required sample proportions, try setting DELTA=0 or increasing the maximum
number of iterations.</p>

<p>By default, the table is checked for empty cells. <strong>CHECKEMPTY</strong>=NO skips that 
check, which can save time and memory.</p>

<p>By default, the GENLOG output and the auxiliary dataset generated by this
procedure are not shown.  <strong>SHOW</strong>=YES causes them to appear.</p>

<p>If the active dataset does not have a name, one is assigned by this procedure.</p>

<p>The output includes a table listing the raked weights and a table showing the
sample balance.  The balance is defined as</p>

<pre><code>100 * sum(Wi,*Ri)**2 / (sum(Wi) * sum(WiRi**2))
</code></pre>

<p>where W is the input weight or 1 if unweighted, and R is the raked weight.
A balance of 100 means no adjustments to the input weights was required.
Although weights are computed for all cells, empty cells have no cases, so
the calculated weight is not shown in the output table as it is never used.</p>

<p><strong>SHOWWEIGHTS</strong> determines whether a table of the weight
values is displayed.  If there are many distinct weights, you may want
to suppress this table.</p> specifies whether or not to display an
unweighted histogram of the case weights</p>

<h2>PLOT</h2>

<p><strong>YVAR</strong> and <strong>XVAR</strong> specify the first two
dimensions of an optional unweighted heatmap of the output weights.  <strong>PANELDOWNVAR</strong> and
<strong>PANELACROSSVAR</strong> can specify panelling for additional
dimensions.  All the variables must occur as control variables in the raking
specification.  The heatmap is not available if there is only one control dimension.</p>

<p><strong>AUTOHEATMAP</strong> is mutually exclusive with the specifications in the
previous paragraph.  The heatmap is generated with the number of dimensions specified,
and the dimensions are defined in the order in which the control variables are listed.
The maximum value for this keyword is four and the minimum is two.</p>

<p>If there are more control variables than are shown in the heatmap, the heatmap
statistics are the weights in each cell defined in the map averaged over the relevant cases.</p>

<p><strong>HISTOGRAM</strong> indicates whether or not to display a histogram
of the case weights accumulated over all the cases.</p>
